  - Using queue to implement a service queue simulation
  - There is an amount out available officers to serve customer. 
  - If an officer is available, an officer will come and begin the service 
  - The time to serve a customer will be generated randomly between a minimum time and maximum time 
  - For customers not yet being served, they will be placed in a queue and wait to be served.
  - Every minute, a random number of customer will get to the queue and wait, if it exceeds the length of the queue, customers must wait to get to the queue 
  - The number of coming customers every minute will be determined randomly using Poisson Distribution Probability. 
  - There is an amount of time -- for a day, to serve customers. After that time has passed, the queue will no long accept customers, but customers already in queue will be served until the last one.
